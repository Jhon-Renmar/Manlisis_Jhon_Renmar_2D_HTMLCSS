						<h2>Motherboard</h2>
						<p>&emsp; The computer motherboard, also known as the mainboard, system board, or logic board, is the central circuit board in a computer that connects all the components together. It is the main hub for communication between the CPU, RAM, hard drive, and other hardware components. <br><br>

						&emsp; The motherboard contains slots and connectors for various components, including the processor socket, memory slots, expansion slots for add-in cards such as graphics cards and network cards, SATA connectors for hard drives and optical drives, USB and audio connectors, and other input/output (I/O) ports. <br><br>
							
						&emsp; The motherboard also contains the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) firmware that initializes the computer hardware and boots up the operating system. In short, the motherboard serves as the backbone of a computer system, providing the necessary connections and functions for all the hardware components to work together. <br><br></p>
						
						
						<h2 id="history">History</h2>
						<p> &emsp; The history of computer motherboards dates back to the mid-1970s with the development of the first microprocessors. In those early days, computers were built using individual electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors, and transistors, which were soldered onto a circuit board. The first microprocessor-based computer, the Altair 8800, was introduced in 1975 and used a backplane board as its main circuit board. <br><br>

						&emsp; The first true motherboard, as we know it today, was introduced in 1981 with the IBM PC. The IBM PC motherboard was a single, large circuit board that contained all the major components, including the CPU, memory, and expansion slots. This made it easy to upgrade and customize the computer, which was a significant advantage over earlier computers that used proprietary designs. <br><br>
							
						&emsp; As the PC market grew in the 1980s and 1990s, so did the complexity of motherboards. The introduction of new technologies, such as the PCI bus, AGP, and USB, led to the development of more sophisticated motherboards with more features and capabilities. In addition, motherboard form factors began to evolve, with the introduction of smaller boards such as the Mini-ITX, Micro-ATX, and ITX. <br><br>
							
						&emsp; Today, motherboards continue to be an essential component of modern computers, providing the necessary connections and functionality for all the hardware components to work together. They have become smaller, more powerful, and more energy-efficient, with new features such as built-in Wi-Fi, advanced cooling solutions, and RGB lighting. <br><br></p>

						<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
						<ul>
							<li id="AT">AT Motherboard: This was the first motherboard standard used in IBM compatible computers. It was introduced in 1984 and used the AT form factor.</li>
							<li id="Baby AT">Baby AT Motherboard: This was a smaller version of the AT motherboard, introduced in 1985. It used the same layout as the AT motherboard, but with a smaller size.</li>
							<li id="ATX">ATX Motherboard: This is the most popular motherboard standard used in modern PCs. It was introduced in 1995 and uses the ATX form factor. It is larger than the Baby AT motherboard and has a more efficient layout.</li>
							<li id="Micro-ATX">Micro-ATX Motherboard: This is a smaller version of the ATX motherboard, introduced in 1997. It has a smaller size and fewer expansion slots.</li>
							<li id="Mini-ITX">Mini-ITX Motherboard: This is the smallest motherboard form factor, introduced in 2001. It is designed for use in small form factor (SFF) computers and uses a compact layout.</li>
							<li id="Extended ATX">Extended ATX (EATX) Motherboard: This is a larger version of the ATX motherboard, designed for high-end systems with multiple graphics cards and other high-performance components.</li>
							<li id="BTX">BTX Motherboard: This was a motherboard standard introduced by Intel in 2004, designed to replace the ATX standard. It was not widely adopted and has since been discontinued.</li>
							<li id="Pico-ITX">Pico-ITX Motherboard: This is the smallest motherboard form factor, introduced in 2007. It is even smaller than the Mini-ITX and is designed for use in ultra-compact computers and embedded systems.</li>
