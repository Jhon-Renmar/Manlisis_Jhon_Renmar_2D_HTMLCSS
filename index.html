						<h2>Computer</h2>
						<p>A computer is an electronic device that can accept, store, process, and output data. It can perform calculations, manipulate text and images, play audio and video, connect to the internet, and run a variety of software applications. Modern computers consist of several key components, including a central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (such as hard drives or solid-state drives), input/output devices (such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor), and various peripherals (such as printers, scanners, and speakers). Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives and are used in a wide range of applications, including education, entertainment, communication, business, science, and engineering.</p>
						
						
						<h2 id="history">History</h2>
						<ul>
							<li id="analytical engine">In the early 1800s, Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, designed the "analytical engine," a mechanical device capable of performing mathematical calculations. Although the machine was never completed, it laid the foundation for modern computing.</li>
							<li id="punched cards">In the late 1800s, Herman Hollerith, an American inventor, developed the first machine for processing data using punched cards. This machine was used to process data from the 1890 US census and led to the development of modern data processing.</li>
							<li id="vacuum tubes">In the 1930s, the first electronic computers were developed. These machines used vacuum tubes for processing data and were large, expensive, and unreliable.</li>
							<li id="ENIAC">In the 1940s, during World War II, the first programmable electronic computer, called Colossus, was developed by British engineer Tommy Flowers to decrypt German messages. Later on, the first general-purpose computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), was built in the United States for military purposes.</li>
							<li >In the 1950s, the first high-level programming languages were developed, including Fortran and COBOL. These languages made it easier to write programs for computers and led to the development of more sophisticated software.</li>
							<li id="minicomputers">In the 1960s, the first minicomputers were developed. These smaller, less expensive computers were used in scientific and engineering applications.</li>
							<li id="IBM PC">In the 1970s, the first personal computers were developed, including the Apple II and the IBM PC. These machines made computing more accessible to individuals and small businesses.</li>
							<li>In the 1980s and 1990s, the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and networking technology led to the widespread adoption of personal computers in homes and offices.</li>
							<li>In the 2000s and beyond, computers have continued to evolve rapidly, with the development of faster processors, larger and more reliable storage devices, and more sophisticated software applications.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
						<ul>
							<li id="Personal computers">Personal computers (PCs): These are the most common type of computer and are designed for individual use. PCs come in different forms such as desktops, laptops, and tablets.</li>
							<li id="Workstations">Workstations: These are powerful computers designed for professionals who require a high level of performance, such as graphic designers, architects, and engineers.</li>
							<li id="Servers">Servers: These are computers that provide services to other computers in a network. Servers can be used to store data, host websites, or manage email.</li>
							<li id="Mainframes">Mainframes: These are large, powerful computers that are used in large organizations such as banks and governments. They are designed to handle massive amounts of data and transactions.</li>
							<li id="Supercomputers">Supercomputers: These are extremely powerful computers that are used for scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, simulation, and research.</li>
							<li id="Embedded">Embedded computers: These are small computers that are embedded in other devices, such as appliances, cars, and medical equipment.</li>
							<li id="Gaming">Gaming computers: These are high-performance computers that are designed to handle demanding gaming applications.</li>
							<li id="Wearable">Wearable computers: These are small computers that are designed to be worn on the body, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers.</li>
